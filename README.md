# Nafas

Nafas (نَفَس), meaning 'breath', is a progressive web app (PWA) for guided breathwork practice. Try it here: ```nafas.websiteplaceholder.com```
It is designed to be run and installed on any PWA capable device, with an emphasis on mobile and offline use. 

The aim of Nafas is to provide users with an accessible and versatile guided breathwork experience, focusing primaliry on tummo-inspired breathwork, but expanding to include other variations in later iterations.

Nafas adheres to principles of digital minimalism, throttling features to what is pragmatic and provides value. In this vein, the project should remain viable as an offline application for all core functions, only requiring online capability to sync user data.
